# Decrypt Cage
[Evervault](https://evervault.com) makes it easy to encrypt data at source, process it in a Cage — a secure, serverless function — and never store it unencrypted.

This Cage decrypts the data that gets passed into it and returns it, meaning you no longer have to store sensitive data.
